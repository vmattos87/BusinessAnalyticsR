Business Data Visualization with R

This project uses an online department store dataset to show how the application of data science tools on business datasets guides strategy planning and decision making by allocating resources to analyze market trends and market forces. The implementation of the R libraries dplyr and ggplot2 to visualize sales and customer data enables decision makers and stakeholders to get insights about business performance and key indicators that influence the market. This knowledge provides important assets to define target customers and new business strategies involving production, marketing and investments.
